# AU-Marketing-Strategy
Visualizations were created in Tableau using data from the American University's Admissions team. 
These visualizations were created with the purpose of analyzing current marketing strategies and determining cost-effective changes that could be made to improve the applied-to-submitted application ratio by students interested in American University. 
This Tableau project is the start towards uncovering more insights, and additional findings will be included in the repository over time.
